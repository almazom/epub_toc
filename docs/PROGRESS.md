# Project Development Guidelines

## Project Status
- Version: 0.1.0
- Status: Alpha
- Code Coverage: 85%
- Python Support: 3.7+

## Development Principles

### SOLID Principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Each class/module has one specific purpose
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Classes open for extension, closed for modification
   - Use inheritance and interfaces for extensibility

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Subclasses must enhance, not replace base class behavior
   - Maintain base class contracts

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Keep interfaces small and focused
   - Clients shouldn't depend on unused methods

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - Depend on abstractions, not implementations
   - Use dependency injection

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Avoid code duplication
- Extract common logic into utility functions
- Use shared components

## Best Practices
1. Documentation
   - All public methods must have docstrings
   - Keep README.md up to date
   - Document changes in CHANGELOG.md

2. Error Handling
   - Use specific exceptions
   - Add informative error messages
   - Log errors with context

3. Testing
   - Write unit tests for public methods
   - Maintain >80% code coverage
   - Use fixtures and mocks for isolation

4. Naming Conventions
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Use snake_case for functions and variables

5. Security
   - No sensitive data in code
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Validate input data

6. Performance
   - Optimize after profiling
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Avoid premature optimization

## Development Process
1. Planning
   - Document requirements
   - Create issues in tracker
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

2. Code
   - Follow project code style
   - Write self-documenting code
   - Make atomic commits

3. Review
   - Conduct code reviews
   - Run linters and tests
   - Check documentation

## Modularity and Reuse
1. Component Design
   - Develop independent modules
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Create clear interfaces
   - Document integration requirements
   - Follow loose coupling principle
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Provide integration examples

2. Configuration
   - Use external config files
   - Provide default settings
   - Validate config parameters
   - Document all options

3. Versioning
   - Follow Semantic Versioning
   - Maintain changelog
   - Support multiple stable versions
   - Mark breaking changes clearly

## Community Guidelines
1. Contributing
   - Fork repository
   - Create feature branch
   - Follow coding standards
   - Submit pull request
   - Participate in code review

2. Communication
   - Use English for all communication
   - Be respectful and inclusive
   - Provide clear context
   - Welcome new contributors

## TOC Extraction Methods Analysis

### Method Effectiveness

1. **epub_meta Method**
   - Works only for well-structured EPUB files (~10% success rate)
   - Provides consistent results when available
   - Limited by metadata quality

2. **NCX Method**
   - Most reliable for structured EPUBs (~90% success rate)
   - Provides hierarchical navigation
   - Fails when NCX file is missing or empty

3. **OPF Method**
   - Works for all EPUB files (100% success rate)
   - Can produce too many items (needs filtering)
   - Best as a fallback method

4. **Automatic Extraction**
   - Combines benefits of all methods
   - Intelligently selects best results
   - Provides consistent output format

### Best Practices for TOC Extraction

1. **Method Selection**
   - Try NCX method first
   - Fall back to epub_meta if available
   - Use OPF as last resort
   - Apply filtering for large TOCs

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Validate TOC structure
   - Check for reasonable item count
   - Verify hierarchy levels
   - Test navigation links

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache extraction results
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Filter unnecessary items early
   - Optimize memory usage

### Future Improvements

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Implement semantic section detection
   - Add support for custom markers
   - Improve heading recognition

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine multiple method results
   - Implement smart filtering
   - Add confidence scoring

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error reporting
   - Add recovery mechanisms
   - Implement validation checks
